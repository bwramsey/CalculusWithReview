\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Recognize a composition of functions.
	\item Take derivatives of compositions of functions using the chain rule.
	\item Take derivatives that require the use of multiple derivative rules.
	\item Use the chain rule to calculate derivatives from a table of values.
	\item Understand rate of change when quantities are dependent upon each other.
	\item Use order of operations in situations requiring multiple derivative rules.
        \item Apply chain rule to relate quantities expressed with different units.
\end{itemize}
