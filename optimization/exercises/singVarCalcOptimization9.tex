\begin{exercise}

  You want to make cylindrical containers to hold 1 liter (1000$\text{cm}^3$) using the
  least amount of construction material.  The side is made from a
  rectangular piece of material, and this can be done with no material
  wasted.  However, the top and bottom are cut from squares of side
  $2r$, so that $2(2r)^2=8r^2$ of material is needed (rather than
  $2\pi r^2$, which is the total area of the top and bottom).  Find
  the dimensions of the container using the least amount of material.
  \begin{prompt}
  \[
  \text{radius}=\answer{5}\text{cm}\qquad\text{height}=\answer{40/\pi}\text{cm}
  \]
