\begin{exercise}



A colony of bacterial are growing in a petri dish.  They form a
circular disk, which appears to be growing at a rate of $4$ square
millimeters per hour.  When the radius of the disk is $3$ millimeters,
at what rate is the radius growing?

\begin{hint}
  Let $A$ be the area of the disk, and $r$ be its radius.  Then
  \[
  A = \pi r^2.
  \]
\end{hint}

\begin{hint}
  Differentiating implicitly with respect to time, we have
  \[
  \dd[A]{t} = 2\pi r \dd[r]{t}.
  \]
\end{hint}

\begin{hint}
  At the time in question, we know $r = 3$, and $\dd[A]{t} = 4$.
  So
  \[
  4 = 2 \pi (3) \dd[r]{t},
  \]

and $\dd[r]{t} = \frac{2}{3\pi}$.
\end{hint}

\begin{prompt}
  At this instant, the radius of this disk is growing at a rate
  of $\answer{\frac{2}{3\pi}}$ millimeters per hour.
\end{prompt}
