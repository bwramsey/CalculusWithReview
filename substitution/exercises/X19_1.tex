\begin{exercise}
	We wish to find the indefinite integral of $\cos(4-3x)$ with respect to $x$.

	What should we use for our substitution variable?
	\[ u = \answer{4-3x} \]
	\begin{hint}
		Is there anything being treated like a variable?  A group being plugged into a common function?
	\end{hint}
	\begin{exercise}
		With $u = 4-3x$, what is the differential?
		\[ \d u = \answer{-3} \d x \]
		\begin{hint}
			Remember that the \emph{differential} of a function $y = f(x)$ is $\d y = f'(x) \d x$.
		\end{hint}
		\begin{exercise}
			Rewrite $\int \cos(4-3x) \d x$ in terms of your substituted variable, $u$.
			\[ \int \cos(4-3x) \d x = \int \answer{-\frac{1}{3}\cos(u) } \d u \]
			\begin{hint}
				Don't forget to also sub in for $\d x$ in terms of $\d u$!
			\end{hint}
			\begin{exercise}
				Evaluate the indefinite integral, in terms of $u$.
				\[ -\frac{1}{3} \int \cos(u) \d u = \answer{-\frac{1}{3}\sin(u) + C} \]
				\begin{hint}
					What function has derivative $\cos(u)$?  What to do with the constant factor of $-1/3$?  Don't forget the $+C$!
				\end{hint}
				\begin{exercise}
					Substitute back in terms of $x$.
					\[ \int \cos(4-3x) \d x = \answer{-\frac{1}{3}\sin(4-3x) + C} \]
				\end{exercise}
