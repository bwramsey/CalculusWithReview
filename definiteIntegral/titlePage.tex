\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Understand how Riemann sums are used to find exact area.
	\item Define net area.
	\item Approximate net area.
	\item Define the definite integral.
	\item Compute definite integrals using limits of Riemann Sums.	
%\item Use integral notation for both antiderivatives and definite integrals.
%\item Use limits of Riemann sums to find the exact area under a curve.
%\item Understand how Riemann sums are used to find exact area.
%\item Split the area under a curve into several pieces to aid with calculations.
%\item Use symmetry to calculate definite integrals.
%\item Explain geometrically why symmetry of a function simplifies calculation of some definite integrals.
