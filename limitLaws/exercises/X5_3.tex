\begin{exercise}	
	Suppose that $a$ is a positive number.  Let $f$ and $g$ be linear functions each of 
	which have $x$-intercepts at the point $(a,0)$.  If $f$ has a $y$-intercept at $(0,5)$ and 
	$g$ has a $y$-intercept at $(0,3)$, then which of the following must be true about
	\[ \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}  \]
	
	\begin{multipleChoice}
		\choice[correct]{It equals $\frac{5}{3}$.}
		\choice{It equals $2$.}
		\choice{It does not exist.}
		\choice{There is not enough information to say.}
	\end{multipleChoice}
