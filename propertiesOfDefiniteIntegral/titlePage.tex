After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Compute definite integrals using geometry.
	\item Compute definite integrals using the properties of integrals.
	\item Justify the properties of definite integrals using algebra or geometry.
	\item Split the area under a curve into several pieces to aid with calculations.
	\item Use symmetry to calculate definite integrals.
	\item Explain geometrically why symmetry of a function simplifies calculation of some definite integrals.
