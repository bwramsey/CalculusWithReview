Let $f(x) = 20 + 8x^2 - x^4$.

$f'(x) = \answer{16x-4x^3}$.

The critical points of $f$ (from left to right) are $\answer{-2}$, $\answer{0}$, and $\answer{2}$.

The absolute maximum of $f$ on the interval $[-1,3]$ is $\answer{36}$ and it occurs at $x=\answer{2}$.

The absolute minimum of $f$ on the interval $[-1,3]$ is $\answer{11}$ and it occurs at $x=\answer{3}$.
