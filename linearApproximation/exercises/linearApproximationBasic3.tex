\begin{exercise}
If $f(5)=1$ and $f'(5) = 4$, then what is the equation of the tangent
line to $f$ at $x=5$?  What is the linear approximation of the value $f(4)$?

\begin{prompt}
The equation of the tangent line to $f$ at $a=5$ is given by:
 \[ y-1 = \answer{4}\cdot(x-\answer{5})\]
 
The linear approximation, $L_5(x)$, of $f$ at $a=5$ is given by:
 \[L_5(x) = \answer{4(x-5)+1}\]
  
 The approximation is given by:
\[ f(4) \approx L_5(4)= \answer{-3}\]
