\begin{exercise}
If $f(2)=3$ and $f'(2) = 2$, then what is the equation of the tangent line to $f$ at $x=2$? What is the
corresponding approximation of the value $f(4)$?.

\begin{prompt}
The equation of the tangent line to $f$ at $a=2$ is given by:
 \[ y-3 = \answer{2}\cdot(x-\answer{2})\]
 
The linear approximation, L_2(x), of $f$ at $a=2$ is given by:
 \[L_2(x) = \answer{2(x-2)+3}\]
  
 The approximation is given by:
\[ f(4) \approx L_2(4)= \answer{7}\]
\end{prompt}
