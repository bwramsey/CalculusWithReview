\begin{exercise}

A rectangular prism is deforming in such a way that it maintains a
constant volume.  At the instant that its height is $2$, its width is
$3$, its length is $4$, its width is growing as a rate of $5
\frac{\textrm{units}}{\textrm{s}}$, and its length is shrinking at a
rate of $2 \frac{\textrm{units}}{\textrm{s}}$, what is the rate of
change in the height of the box?

\begin{hint}
If we let $L$, $W$, and $H$ be the length, width, and height of the
box, respectively, then we know that
\[
LWH = 2(3)(4) = 24
\]
since the box has constant volume.
\end{hint}

\begin{hint}	
  Differentiating implicitly with respect to time, we obtain
\[
L'(t)W(t)H(t)+L(t)W'(t)H(t)+L(t)W(t)H'(t) = 0
\]
for all $t$.
\end{hint}

\begin{hint}
  At the time in question, say $t = t_0$, we have
\[
(-2)(3)(2)+(4)(5)(2)+(4)(3)H'(t) = 0.
\]
\end{hint}

\begin{hint}	
  Solving for $H'(t)$, we get $H'(t) = \frac{-7}{3}\frac{\textrm{units}}{\textrm{s}}.$
\end{hint}

\begin{prompt}
  \[
  \dd[H]{t} = \answer{\frac{-7}{3}}\frac{\textrm{units}}{\textrm{s}}
  \]
\end{prompt}
