The population (in millions of cells) of a culture of bacteria is given by the function $P(t)$ where $t$ is measured in weeks after some start date.

Below is a partial table of values of $P(t)$.
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
t & 0 & 1 & 3 & 4\\\hline
P(t) & 0 & 50 & 75 & 80\\\hline
\end{array} 
\]

The average rate of change of the population during the time interval $[0,4]$ is $\answer{20}$ million cells per week.

Suppose that $P(t)$ is continuous on $[0,\infty)$ and differentiable on $(0,\infty)$. Then we know that $P$ \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{satisfies}\choice{does not satisfy}} the conditions of the Mean Value Theorem so \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{there exists}\choice{there does not necessarily exist}} a $c>0$ such that $f'(c)$ equals the above calculated average rate of change of the population.
