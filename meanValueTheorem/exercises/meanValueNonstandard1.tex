Let $f(x) = Ax^2+Bx+C$.  Find the constant $c$, known to exist by the mean value theorem, for which $f'(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are any two distinct real numbers.  The result is a very interesting property of quadratics.  Can you explain this result more conceptually, and less algebraically?

\begin{prompt}
	$$c = \answer{\frac{b+a}{2}}$$
