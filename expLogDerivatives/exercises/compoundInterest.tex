	If an investment is made with a principal of \$200, invested at 24\% interest, compounded monthly, the value is
	given by the compound interest formula:
	\[ A(t) = 200(1.02)^{12 t} \]
	with $t$ in years after the investment.
	
	After how many years has the investment doubled? (Round to 1 decimal place)
	\[ t = \answer{2.9} years \]
	\begin{exercise}
		Find the derivative, $\ddt{A(t)}$.
		
		\[ \ddt{A(t)} = \answer{ 2400(1.02)^{12t} } \]
		
		\begin{exercise}
			How fast is the balance growing (in dollars/year) after 3 years? (Round to 1 decimal place)
		
			\[ \eval{\ddt{A(t)}}_{t=3} =  \answer{ 96.9 } \text{ dollars/ year }\]
